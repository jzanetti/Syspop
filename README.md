**Syspop** is a package developed to simplify and modularize the synthesis of populations, enhancing efficiency and user-friendliness. The outputs generated by **Syspop** are independent of any downstream applications, such as agent-based models, making them versatile inputs for various modeling needs or standalone products. 

The documentation for the package can be found [here](https://github.com/jzanetti/Syspop/wiki). Any questions please contact: _Sijin.Zhang@esr.cri.nz_

## Installation
The package can be installed via:
```
pip install syspop
```

## Usage

### syspop.create 

A synthetic population can be created using:

```
from syspop.syspop import create as syspop_create

syspop_create(
    syn_areas = [135400, 111400, 110400],
    output_dir = "/tmp/syspop_test",
    pop_gender = pop_data["gender"],
    pop_ethnicity = pop_data["ethnicity"],
    geo_hierarchy = geog_data["hierarchy"],
    geo_location = geog_data["location"],
    geo_address = geog_data["address"],
    household = household_data["household"],
    socialeconomic = geog_data["socialeconomic"],
    work_data = work_data,
    home_to_work = commute_data["home_to_work"],
    school_data = school_data["school"],
    hospital_data = hospital_data["hospital"],
    supermarket_data = supermarket_data["supermarket"],
    restaurant_data = restaurant_data["restaurant"],
    assign_address_flag = True,
    rewrite_base_pop = False,
    use_parallel = True,
    ncpu = 8
)
```

Detailed descriptions of the input data for each argument can be found in [Input data](https://github.com/jzanetti/Syspop/wiki/Input-data).

It's important to note that all arguments in the ``syspop.create`` function are optional, and their requirement depends on the specific synthetic information that needs to be generated. To understand the interdependencies between different synthetic information, refer to the documentation available [here](https://github.com/jzanetti/Syspop/wiki/Synthetic-population)

### syspop.validate

The produced syntehtic population from ``syspop.create`` can be validated using the function of ``syspop.validate``:

```
from syspop.syspop import validate as syspop_validate
syspop_validate(
    output_dir=output_dir,
    pop_gender=pop_data["gender"],
    pop_ethnicity=pop_data["ethnicity"],
    household=household_data["household"],
    work_data=work_data,
    home_to_work=commute_data["home_to_work"],
)
```

The above codes provide validation for the produced synthetic population, which must be stored in ``<output_dir>/syspop_base.csv``. Details for synthetic population validation can be found [here](https://github.com/jzanetti/Syspop/wiki/Validation).

## Release (for developer)
The package can be released by running:

```
make publish
```

Note that before the release, it is suggested to check the latest version by ``make pkg_version``, and then adjust the version number in ``setup.py`` accordingly.
